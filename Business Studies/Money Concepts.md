#### Legal Requirements

Business owners have a **statutory duty** to keep accounts. As director, you could in principle go to jain if accounts aren't kepr or are inaccurate.

You must:
- **Keep proper books of account**: Recognised format and be a true, onest and fair statement of teh comanpy's account. Must publish every year a trading (profit and loss) account, balance sheet, and cash-flow statement (historic).
- **Annual Audit**: Must have books audited annually by a recognised and licensed practitioner, to give independent confirmation of how well/badly company is doing.
- **Solvency**: Justifiable belief  that you can either raise the money or make sufficient profits to enable you to pay your bills as they fall due. If you cannot pay and have no prospects of being able to do so, you have a statutory duty to declare bankruptcy and shut the company down. Failure to do so is **fraud**, for which you can go to jail.

#### Double Entry Bookkeeping

Devised as a way of checking against error before computers. Money entered twice, once as the source and once as the sink. Should add to zero at the end.

Buying something increases value of stock but decreases value in account and vice versa for selling.

**Big ledger**: LHS has positive entries: **debits**, this is, money received or due to be received. RHS has **Credits**: money paid by the business, or owed by the business. The two totals should be equal

#### Good Principles

Don't question the way accountants do things.

Every **debit and every credit** will eventually appear in either a *balance sheet* or a *profit and loss account*.

#### Profit and Loss Account

| Debit                                                                        | Credit                                    |
|------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------|
| Cost of goods sold (all goods for resale minus any stocks left at the time). | Sales (invoices raised or cash recieved). |
| Expenses (All the costs including wages)                                     |                                           |
| Profit (always a balancing figure)                                           |                                           |
