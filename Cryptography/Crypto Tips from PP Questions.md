In general, be more specific with your answer if asked to briefly describe. Also some parts I was flat out wrong.


What a Galois field is.


- ECDSA and why its better than DSA. The main point is that using the Index Calculation Algorithm to solve the discrete logarithm problem is way faster in Elliptic Curve groups compared to $Z_p^*$ or something.
- Why we can used elliptic curves for diffie hellman, or for ElGamal encryption (which is basically DSA).
