Note how in the above image, he uses the $\mapsto$ symbol with a superscript of a matrix to represent the gate being used. 


Also, let us say we are measuring one of three qubits in a system. We use the $M_0$ measurement operator for the first qubit, and for the second two we use the identity. To denote this we can use: $P_o := \ket{0}\bra{0} \otimes I$. In this case, the $I$ denotes a $4 \times 4$ matrix, and doesn't necessarily need to denote a $2 \times 2$ matrix.
