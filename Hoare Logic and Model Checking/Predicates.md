$\{P\}~C~\{Q\}$

This page us how to write assertations (state predicates, like P or Q above) and what they mean when writing out Hoare triples.

The lectures lay out the assertion syntax and semantics both informally and formally, these notes will just cover the formal definitions.


##### Assertions Syntax
Lecture 3 slide 17

$$\begin{align}

\mathcal{X} ::= X | x \\
t ::= \mathcal{X} | f(t_1, ..., t_n) \\
P, Q ::= \bot | \top | P \wedge Q | P \lor Q | P \limp
\end{align}
