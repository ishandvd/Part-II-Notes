## Specific Comments


##### Debt Financing
Is loan financing: can be in the form of using credit cards, overdrafts, mortgages, or direct loans, or more. You may also open yourself more conditions and to having to provide collateral.

You pay back the principle with some form of interest over a fixed period of time.

##### Equity Financing
Selling a share of your company. Future value of the equity is dependent on the performance of the company and maybe realised through the payment of dividends or the sale of the equity at a future point.

If the company becomes insolvent then debt repayment has priority over equity.

##### Loan vs Overdraft

**Loan**: amount paid upfront and drawn down over a fixed period of time, regardless of how much money is needed over time. Interest is paid.

**Overdraft**: Can draw down a debt whenever needed, with interest paid on the amount drawn at any given time.


##### Drawing Cash flow statements

- Assume a two month (60 day) delay between an invoice being given out and payment being received.
