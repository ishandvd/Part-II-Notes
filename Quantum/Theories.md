#### Four Postulates

##### Postulate 1: State Space

##### Postulate 2: Evolution

##### Postulate 3: Measurement

##### Postulate 4: Composition

The state place of a composite physical system is the tensor product ($\otimes$) of the state spaces of the component physical systems (i.e. the physical qubits).

If we have systems numbered 1 through n, and the system number i is prepared in the state $\ket{\psi_i}$ then the join state of the total system is $\ket{\psi_i} \otimes \ket{\psi_}$

#### Depolarising Channel

The quantum equivalent of the classical noise channel. It allows us to model bit flips, phase flips, and combined bit-phase flips. Where a physical qubit is left unchanged with probability $1 - p_e$, it experiences a bit-flip with probability $\frac{p_e}{ 3}$, a phase-flip with probability $\frac{p_e}{ 3}$, and a combined flip with probability $\frac{p_e}{ 3}$.

The Shore code suppresses the error from $p_e$ to $\mathcal{O}(p$
